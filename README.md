This project is based on NLP and Web Scrapping techniques and then re verifying the results using 3 ML models. In this project we have scrapped user reviews from IMDB site for different series and movies, using BeautifulSoup.
The scrapped comments are then stored in form of a csv file. The data of the csv file is then used as a reference for Textblob to find the nature of each comment. 
The nature of the comment is given as Positive, Negative or Neutral.
This result is then re verified by using three ML algorithms for the verification that the result given by Textblob is is correct
